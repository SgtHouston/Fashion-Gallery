Swatches do not have tracking at this time. \n \n For Atlanta Area Customers: Pick-ups are available for dresses at our showroom location or you can choose to have them shipped. Packages are signature required. We are not responsible for packages that are lost or stolen by the delivery carrier. Insurance options are available per request. \n"
