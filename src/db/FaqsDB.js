Express shipping is an option as well. \n International shipping usually takes anywhere from five business days to 10 business days, depending on the country. \n At SLR Couture, we work hard to make sure every package is delivered on time and in excellent condition. However, once your order leaves our showroom we have very little control over UPS or Canada Post and we are unable to make any changes to the package. We do not ship to a P.O Box. All orders are shipped via UPS Ground or Canada Post. Expedited shipping is available for an additional charge. \n We will send an email once your order has shipped, including a tracking number, so you can follow the package's journey until it arrives at your doorstep. Swatches do not have tracking at this time. \n \n For Atlanta Area Customers: Pick-ups are available for dresses at our showroom location or you can choose to have them shipped. Packages are signature required. We are not responsible for packages that are lost or stolen by the delivery carrier. Insurance options are available per request. \n"

You must contact us immediately at slrcouture@gmail.com to discuss the circumstances surrounding the cancellation well in advance of your production date.  \n \n All custom made items are considered final sale and do not qualify for return, refund or store credits."
